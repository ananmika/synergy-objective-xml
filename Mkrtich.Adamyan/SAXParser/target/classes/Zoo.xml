			Its name says it all: this fox has big ears, and they come in handy for a variety of reasons. First of all, big ears help shed body heat (by cooling the blood that circulates near the bare surface of the ears) – a great feature for this hot-climate critter. Second, big ears help the fox listen for its primary prey, insects (an unusual diet for foxes!). Finally, the fox makes visual signals with its ears to help keep in contact with other members of its family group.
